Hey there! Welcome to my blog. I am Hetanshi, A 2nd year Media, Journalism and Publishing student. I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in pop culture and typography and stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework and professional development.

Here are some random unimportant facts about me:
I love to take pictures of nature and skies (my gallery is filled with pics of flowers)
I can speak 4 languages- English, Hindi, Gujarati and Marathi
I love cooking 
My favorite T.V show is Friends
I am from India

That's me! 

Whenever I go shopping, I tend to notice the minute things and that includes fonts and typefaces of products. 

Be it an online website or a journal, I pay attention to the fonts and how it affects our daily life by influencing us.

In my blogs, I have written some mind-blowing facts about Typography and how it plays a huge role in our daily-life as well as our cognitive behaviour.
