Whether it’s on our phones, in books or on websites, we’re constantly digesting written words. From instruction booklets to shop fronts, type is all around us.

### 1. What is typography?

Let’s kick off with the basics: what actually is typography? In essence, typography is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader. Typography involves font style, appearance, and structure, which aims to elicit certain emotions and convey specific messages. In short, typography is what brings the text to life.

### 2. Why is typography important?

Typography is so much more than just choosing beautiful fonts: it’s a vital component of user interface design. Good typography will establish a strong visual hierarchy, provide a graphic balance to the website, and set the product’s overall tone. Typography should guide and inform your users, optimize readability and accessibility, and ensure an excellent user experience.

1. ### Typography builds brand recognition

Not only will good typography enhance the website’s personality, but your users will subliminally begin to associate the typeface featured on your site with your brand. Unique, consistent typography will help you establish a strong user following, build trust with your users, and help to carry your brand forward.

2. ### Typography influences decision making

Typography has a profound effect on the way that users digest and perceive the information conveyed by the text. Eye-catching type is much more persuasive than weak fonts that don’t reinforce the message of the text.

3. ### Typography holds the attention of the readers

Good typography could be the difference between someone staying on your website for one minute or half an hour. It’s important that your website is visually stimulating and memorable, and typography plays a huge role in this process.

## The different elements of typography

### Colour

Colour is one of the most exciting elements of typography. This is where designers can really get creative and elevate the interface to a new level. Text colour, however, is not to be taken lightly: nailing your font colour can make the text stand out and convey the tone of the message —but getting it wrong can result in a messy interface and text that clashes with the site colours.

Colour has three key components: value, hue, and saturation. A good designer will know how to balance these three components to make the text both eye-catching and clearly legible, even for those with visual impairments. Often, designers will test this by viewing the text in greyscale (without colour) and making tweaks if the text is too dark or too light against the background colour.

### Hierarchy

Establishing hierarchy is one of the most vital principles of typography. Typographical hierarchy aims to create a clear distinction between prominent pieces of copy that should be noticed and read first, and standard text copy. In an age of short attention spans brought about by social media, designers are urged to be concise and create typefaces that allow users to consume the necessary information in short amounts of time.
