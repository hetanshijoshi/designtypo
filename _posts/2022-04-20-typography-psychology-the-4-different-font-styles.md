### 1. Serif font psychology

Starting with the most traditional font option, serif fonts promote feelings of class and heritage, making them ideal when you want to create a company that feels “established”. Due to their classical nature, serif fonts carry feelings of trust and respectability, making them perfect for brand identities that revolve around authority and grandeur.

Serif fonts work best in “formal” situations. They’re perfect for companies who want to build brand awareness while demonstrating their trustworthy nature. Often, serif types are ideal for financial companies, academics, broadsheets, and editorials. Some of the most popular options are:

* Times New Roman
* Georgia
* Garamond

### 2. Sans serif font psychology

Sans serif fonts are clean, modern, and engaging. They’re used by brands who want to demonstrate a straight-forward, simple, and no-nonsense attitude. When it comes to typography in logo design, sans serif solutions indicate a sense of honesty and sensibility. There are no decorative elements distracting the eye or clouding the message.

The simple, yet effective nature of sans serif fonts make them perfect for brands who want to put clarity first when designing their company logo. Often, you’ll find these typefaces on clothing brands, technology companies, and businesses that are focused on “forward-thinking” ideals and brand purposes. A few of the best sans-serif fonts are:

* Arial
* Century Gothic
* Helvetica

### 3. Script font psychology

Script fonts are generally a lot fancier than their serif counterparts. They’re intended to provoke ideas of femininity, elegance, and creativity, thanks to their hand-written nature. If you want to make your company, feel more personal, and improve your chances of earning that all-important customer affinity, then script typefaces could be the perfect option. However, it’s important to make sure that the script you choose is legible.

When it comes to typography psychology, script fonts are probably the ones most likely to inspire emotional and creative ideas. They’re perfect for when you want to convey feeling, history, or experience, and can be particularly useful for “visual” brands who want to show off their creative side. The key is to use script fonts with caution. While they look artful and fancy, they can also be difficult to read in certain contexts. A couple of options to try might be:

* Lucida Script
* Lobster
* Zapfino

### 4. Modern font psychology

“Modern” typography sounds like it should be the most futuristic of the bunch. However, the truth is that it’s been around since the eighteenth century. Designed to be simple and legible, modern fonts come with thin and thick transitions in the strokes between letters, and they can also have thin horizontal serifs.

When using typography in design for logos, modern fonts are used to convey feelings of exclusivity, intelligence, and style. If you’re hoping to showcase your brand name in a way that’s easy to read, and brimming with modern flare, then this font type could be just right for your brand. It’s fantastic at attracting the attention of millennials, thanks in part to its association with Facebook. Here are some modern fonts to explore:

* Matchbook
* Politica
* Klavika
